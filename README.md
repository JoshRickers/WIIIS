As computer games consoles become more and more like computers the need for
forensic investigation methodologies and software also increases. Many new games
console have hard drives that are able to store images, films and music on them and
because of this they can be used to store illegal content. Games console can also be
modified to run homebrew applications that give access to hidden areas of the storage of
the games console, adding further hiding places for illegal files. This report describes
different consoles and their method of modification and the implementation of an image
carver for two games consoles.

The Nintendo Wii Image Search will search for .jpg files stored on an external SD card
and display their location on screen.
